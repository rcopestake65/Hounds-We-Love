## About Us
HoundsWeLove was established in 2016 by Kevin and Angelita Brokenshire. Combining over 50 years’ experience of caring for many different breeds of dog, we love hounds of all shapes and sizes. We offer friendly, reliable and professional dog walking, training and behavioural services in London N16 and surrounding areas.

We have a small dedicated team of colleagues who share our love of dogs.

Kevin, Angelita and Liam all have up to date DBS and are Canine 1st Aid Trained. We are fully insured by Pet Business Insurance and are licensed by the Lea Valley Park Authority to walk in their fabulous green spaces.

Kevin and Angelita have studied canine behaviour and training extensively. They are first and foremost dog owners, and relate to the dogs they work with in the same caring and respectful way they relate to their own. They are both working towards the ISCP Advanced Diploma in Canine Behaviour.

Kevin is a fully qualified trainer and member of the IMDT; he has completed a number of courses with Canine Principles and the IMDT, amongst others. He is a qualified former school teacher with over 15 years experienced of working in education. Kevin is a member of the Pet Professionals Guild and volunteer at Glendee Dog Rescue.
 
Liam is currently working towards becoming a qualified behaviourist with the IMDT.

### How we work
We are committed to positive reinforcement training methods. Central to our approach is building a trusting bond with your dog, using empathy, compassion and clear and consistent communication.

#### Dog Walking

We walk dogs off lead in compatible groups of a maximum of four dogs per walker. During our walks the welfare of the dogs is our priority. We have spent many hours observing dogs and their interactions, learning how they communicate and how to effectivity communicate with them. This helps us to ensure that they are very well supervised, and their needs are met.

Basic training and reinforcing polite behaviour are an integral part of our walks. Your dog will be collected and returned as part of our service. As we work locally, within a small catchment area, your dog will spend little time in transit and lots of time playing with their doggy friends.

We can offer 1:1 walks and/or pavement walks by special arrangement.

#### Dog Training and Behavioural Services

Our training philosophy is rooted in modern, scientifically sound techniques that have proven hugely effective both with our own and our client’s dogs. We will never advocate the use of aversive training methods. As proud members of the IMDT and ISCP we agree to follow their [Code of Ethics](/pdf/IMDT-ISCP-Code-of-Ethics.pdf).


### Where we work
#### Dog Walking

We are fortunate enough to be in close proximity of Walthamstow, Leyton and Hackney Marshes and Springfield Park. All of these spaces offer large areas for the dogs to run and play safely off lead. Whether your dog loves leaping through tall grass, strolling in flowery meadows or a refreshing swim, our walks offer it all.

#### Training and Behavioural Services

We currently offer face to face group Puppy Classes at Hackney Rugby Club, E5 9BL. We offer face to face training and behavioural consultations throughout Central London. Not local? No problem! We can also offer training and behaviour consultations via Zoom.
