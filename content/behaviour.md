## Behaviour Support

We understand that problem behaviours can be stressful and draining. Fortunately, we can help you understand how your dog approaches the world, the driving forces behind their actions and work with you to develop a plan to improve their behaviour.

We can help resolve a range of behavioural issues including:

- Excessive barking
- Separation Anxiety
- Guarding food, toys, personal items, or physical spaces
- Reactivity/aggression towards yourself or other people
- Reactivity/aggression towards other dogs
- Destructive behaviours, such as digging or chewing inc. mail deliveries
- Chasing – runners, cyclists, squirrels, cats etc
- Toileting indoors
- Noise/firework phobia
- Jumping up/counter surfing….and many more.

### How does it work?
#### Initial Assessment

We’ll carry out an initial assessment, lasting approximately two hours. We’ll need information about your dog’s background and their problem behaviours to help us understand the cause of the problem/s. We’ll also discuss your aims, to help devise an agreed and realistic plan of action.

We can explore and advise some practical training techniques to help you manage your dog. These can often be simple adjustments to your routines or home layout that can have a big impact upon the behavioural issues you are experiencing.

Our assessment will be followed with a detailed written report including step by step instructions of any training we have undertaken, a summary of what we believe is causing the behaviour/s and a plan of action, including recommendations for the future and any appropriate supporting literature.

#### Follow up sessions

The number of hourly follow up sessions will depend upon the nature of the behavioural problem/s and your overall aims. Modifying a dog’s behaviour can take time, patience, and determination. We can guide you through the process and be available via phone, text and email to offer any additional support you may require.

#### How long will it take?

It’s impossible for predict how long it might take and we are unable to offer any guarantees. Our clients often notice significant improvements following the first session. Moving forward, lots of practise and consistency make a huge difference.

#### How much does it cost?

The Initial Assessment costs £80, whilst follow up sessions cost £50 each. A block of four follow up sessions can be purchased for £160.
