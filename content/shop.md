Welcome to our shop. Everything we sell is handmade by Kevin at our small home based studio in Hackney.

Using traditional leather craft techniques, Kevin makes bespoke dog leads and training long lines, . We use premium vegetable tanned leather and high quality solid cast fittings. Only natural products are used to condition and wax our leather items. We also use BioThane, a 'vegan leather' that is very durable, soft to the touch and available in a wonderful range of vibrant colours. It is also waterproof, machine washable and easy to sanitise.

In addition to popular items, available in our Etsy shop, we can create any item to your specific requirements.

All of our lead and training long line designs have been thoroughly 'scratch, swim, wrestle and roll in mud' tested by our resident hounds Chundo and Violet.
