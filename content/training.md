### New puppy/rescue dog – getting off to the right start

The arrival of a puppy or rescue dog into your home is a hugely exciting time, but can be tiring too! We can help ensure that you and your new four legged friend get off the right start. We offer a two hour consultation either at your home or via Zoom to guide you through their transition into your home. We will create a detailed plan to ensure your dog is safe, comfortable and their new routine promotes good habits and a close bond with you and your family.
