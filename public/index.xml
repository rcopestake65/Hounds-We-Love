      <description>Welcome to our shop. Everything we sell is handmade by Kevin at our small home based studio in Hackney.
Using traditional leather craft techniques, Kevin makes bespoke dog leads, collars, training long lines, belts, wallets and other small leather items. We use premium vegetable tanned leather and high quality solid cast fittings. Only natural products are used to condition and wax our leather items. We also use BioThane, a ‘vegan leather’ that is very durable, soft to the touch and available in a wonderful range of vibrant and reflective colours.</description>

      <description>Socialisation Why socialise? Puppies of approximately 3 to 16 weeks of age are within the most important developmental stages of their life, their ‘puppy socialisation window’. During this time your puppy’s brain is uniquely able to form new neurological connections which will guide them later in life when deciding whether or not they are safe with everything they encounter in life.
There are many other factors that have a significant influence upon your puppy: these include genetics, the level of stress their mother endures during and after pregnancy, untreated or undiagnosed pain, current environment and past learning; however the difference between puppies who did not receive socialisation within this window vs similar puppies in similar environments who did is drastic and has been well documented in scientific literature.</description>

      <description>Walking Our walks take advantage of the wonderful space and varied landscapes of Lea Valley Park and surrounding green spaces.
Whether you have a large high energy puppy or a small senior, we will provide a suitable walk with carefully selected four legged friends. We can potentially accommodate dogs of all shapes and sizes and have experience of working with unneutered males.
We collect and drop off from a small catchment area, ensuring your dog’s time in transit is minimal.</description>
