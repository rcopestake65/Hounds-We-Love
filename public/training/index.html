	<p>Kevin has been an amazing resource while raising our cockapoo. Between the immersive one-on-one training to providing in depth recaps of the work we do each day, we are barely able to keep up with Chili’s quick wit! Kevin has made training easy to understand, and always there as a resource should we have any questions.</p>
